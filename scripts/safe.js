/* 
 * [Aug 2023] Finally, after 3 years have passed, I made the overlapping mechanism.
 * Audio overlapping is necessary for historic accuracy. The original flash version used to randomly overlap the song over itself.
 * I also think it sounds funnier and less respectful when overlapped.
 * Despite the constants .45 and .5, the JS audio jank at times makes it sound nice and random.
